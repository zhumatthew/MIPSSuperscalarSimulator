    // Because there are no pipeline registers in this simulator, when the source register for forwarding is EX|MEM, this field is assigned a value of 4. This indicates that when forwarding, the data will be found in the current instruction of the write-back stage. The "SW" instruction is unique in that all other instructions only need to be forwarded at the EX stage and only have one register (rs or rt) to be forwarded. Since every cycle is processed in reverse order from WB to IF, the only possibility to be considered is forwarding from EX|MEM to EX.
